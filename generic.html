										<h1>Physiological Evolution</h1>
									</header>

									
									<p>Temperature affects many body processes through its effect on protein function, ranging from
reproduction, digestion, and metabolism. Genetic variation in heat tolerance can result in
physiological diversification over macroevolutionary time. Consequently, genetic adaptation
might come at a high cost. I seek to understand the constraints and limitations of species to adapt
to changing environments by their capacity to respond physiologically to new ecological
challenges.</p></p>
									<p>How species have evolved in the past provides us with important information regarding speciesâ€™
evolutionary potential. For example, endotherms evolved homeothermy millions of years ago,
opening new niches and opportunities that may not have previously existed. Particularly,
mammals and birds occupy wider ranges than ectotherms and are adapting across environmental
gradients faster.</p>

			
									<p>Evolution leaves a clear signal on species' physiological and ecological diversification, which
makes the phylogenetic history cover a species' adaptations to a changing world. Most
phylogenetic studies have examined morphological traits and ignored important physiological
traits that are equally tied to the environment. My research integrates physiological and
behavioral traits with phylogenetic approaches to associate these traits with environmental
changes that have occurred in the past, which helps develop better predictions of how species
adaptations may proceed with global warming. </p>

									
									<p>Macroevolutionary predictability of mammal responses to novel physiological threats is an
understudied phenomenon. My research addresses this question by leveraging the availability of
trait databases, phylogenetic trees, and environmental data. With this data, I compare the
adaptations and tolerance to climatic conditions of endotherms and ectotherms and evaluate how
thermal physiology evolves. In my analysis, I account for past and present climatic conditions,
and I use statistical models that incorporate thermal physiology and environmental variables in a
phylogenetic framework. For some groups, such as hibernating bats, I test whether these thermal
adaptations may hold predictive power for predicting susceptibility to a temperature-dependent
fungus.</p>
